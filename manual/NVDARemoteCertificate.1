.SH NAME
NVDARemoteCertificate \- Generate a certificate for NVDA Remote Server
.SH SYNOPSIS
NVDARemoteCertificate
.SH DESCRIPTION
The NVDARemoteCertificate script attempts to generate a self-signed SSL certificate for your server. It is highly recommended that you run this script before starting the server for the first time, as utilizing the default certificate presents potential security risks.
.P
Once started, you will be prompted to enter some information for your certificate (organization, name, e-mail, country code, ...).
After that, a self-signed certificate  and private key will be generated and stored in the file server.pem. On Unix systems, you will find this file at /usr/share/NVDARemoteServer/server.pem. On Windows, this file is in the same location as the server executable.
.SH OPTIONS
No options are required.
